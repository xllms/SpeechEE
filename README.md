# Speech Event Extraction Challenge

We propose the Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) challenge on the XLLM platform. Unlike traditional textual event extraction, SpeechEE aims to detect event triggers and arguments directly from audio speech, even when transcripts are unavailable. The SpeechEE is defined as: Given a speech audio input consisting of a sequence of acoustic frames, the goal is to extract structured event records comprising four elements: 1) the event type, 2) the event trigger, 3) event argument roles, and 4) the corresponding event arguments.
